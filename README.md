# 3D-Graphics-Base
This is a basic 3D graphics program that takes in ASCII .stl files and displays them. 
How to use the program:
1. Run Runner.java to start the program
2. Select the ASCII .stl file you want to display.
3. Use the WASD keys to move forward, left, back, and right respectively.
4. Use the arrow keys to rotate the camera.
5. Use the shift key to move down and the space bar to move up.
6. You can change the movement speed of the camera in the Camera.java file.
7. You can add new .stl files to display with the ADD MODEL button.
8. You can click on a model (It will turn blue) and hit the delete key to remove it from the display.

That's all! 
I was inspired to do this because I wanted to create a simulation of 3D objects with physics. I needed to create my own 3D graphics program first though.
